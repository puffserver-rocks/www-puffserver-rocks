Last updated 2022.01.16

2022.01.15 - drop vote warning down to 5 seconds so it fires during freezetime, other small tweaks/fixes
2022.01.14 - add !votezeusrecharge, properly restart rounds for restriction votes
2022.01.13 - initial publish

connect beta.puffserver.rocks; password puffbeta;

=================================================================================
Beta night round two results:
  - Learned that these plugins are somewhat broken:
    - Knifefights - crashes every client somehow - worked properly a few times. Maybe an issue re: players controlling bots?
    - CustomVotes - sometimes (often) doesn't display vote to all players
    - ExtraSpawnPoints - appears to be creating spawns at deathmatch spawn locations
  - Confirmed an engine bug with mp_drop_knife_enable 1 that:
    - Prevents you from picking up a dropped knife if you have a zeus in your inventory
    - Prevents you from spawning with a knife if you have a zeus in your inventory
    - A potential workaround is being investigated
  - Dodgeball mode (!votedodgeball) is absolute chaos and the best thing ever
Ideas generated:
  - !votealltalk !votealltalkoff
  - !voteknifeonly
  - Custom gamemodes should last one round by default
  - (unlimited) breach charge only on de_inferno_destruct? (poll open)




=================================================================================
Plugins pending review:
  - Steam group based admin management plugin
    - Would assign flags based on group memebership
    - Greatly ease application of future donor tags/permissions/etc




Currently implemented (on beta):
=================================================================================
CSGO Server Process:
  - Automatic updates with a 30 second warning
  - Discord notifications for start/stop/update

=================================================================================
General Config:
  - Cash, armor, etc configs pulled over from old puff
  - Core sourcemod databases on mysql instead of sqlite
  - Fast-DL (we don't need it but it's there)
  - Killer Replays
  - mp_drop_knife_enable 1 (on beta, awaiting feedback)

=================================================================================
Map management:
Sourcemod mapchooser => mapchooser-extended
  - Vote at start of first possible last round
    - Unable to vote at end of match b/c podium blur overlays sourcemod menu :(
  - "No Vote" option in slot 1 and block slots 2, 3 when vote active
  - 45 second vote duration
  - 5 second warning countdown before vote in hintbox
  - Vote progress displayed in hintbox
  - !nominate shows searched maps instead of selecting first match
  - !rtv mostly unchanged

=================================================================================
Plugins:
1v1 Knife Fight - Disabled for now pending review/rewrite
  - Offers a knife fight when there is a 1v1
    - This uses the sourcemod menus which might be distracting 
      - explore having a !knifefight command instead?
  - Teleports players to eachother and restricts to knife only for the duration of the fight
  - Returns weapons after the fight

Adverts
  - Now has a join message with a link to where the rules.txt will be
  - Rest of adverts are randomized and normalized

!helpmenu
  - Provides a !helpmenu with:
    - Short rules, server info, public command list, map list

Discord Notifications
  - Prints a message to discord on map change when there are more than 8 people in the server
  - Needs further testing, might be too noisy and require further modification

AFK Management
  - Moves players to spectate if they are afk
    - 120 seconds total
    - 60 seconds in spawn

SoD Stats
  - Running with mysql instead of sqlite db (uses sourcemod builtin)
  - Replace with gameme.com stats?

Admin tags
  - Admins who wish to be tagged can be

ExtraSpawnPoints - Disabled for now pending review/rewrite
  - Creates extra spawn points on top of existing ones when less than X spawns are on the map
  - Hopefully fixes the "this map is limited to 10 people" problems
